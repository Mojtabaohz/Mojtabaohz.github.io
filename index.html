                    <p>Wintor is an augmented reality platform designed to bridge the gap between physical and virtual experiences. As a key contributor to this project, I worked on designing and optimizing AR tours, focusing on user-centric features and seamless cross-platform functionality. My role involved enhancing the app’s code infrastructure, integrating advanced AR/VR libraries, and ensuring consistent performance across mobile and web platforms. By actively observing user behavior on-site, I reshaped features, improved the UI/UX, and contributed to creating engaging, easy-to-use AR content. Wintor exemplifies my passion for immersive technologies and innovation in storytelling.</p>

                    <p>Magrid is an educational mobile app that empowers young learners with its innovative approach to visual learning. As the lead mobile developer, I spearheaded the development and optimization of the app on Unity, ensuring its availability across multiple platforms including iOS and Android. Magrid is now used in over five countries and more than 400 schools, positively impacting the education of thousands of students. My contributions included developing user-friendly features, managing app store deployments, and integrating cross-platform solutions to enhance accessibility and engagement. Magrid stands as a testament to my ability to create impactful, scalable applications that make a difference.</p>

                    <h3>Northern Farm</h3>
                    <h5>2017-2019</h5>
                    <p>Northern Farm was a unique farming simulation game with a distinctive Persian theme, featuring localized items, ingredients, and engaging mini-games. The project included the development of social features, such as clans and item trading, as well as special themed live events to enhance player engagement and retention.

                        As part of the design and development team, I focused on improving key performance indicators (KPIs) and revenue through data-driven strategies. These included implementing A/B tests, analyzing player behavior, and introducing features to optimize the game’s lifecycle and maximize player satisfaction.
                        
                        Though no longer available, Northern Farm remains a highlight of my career as it combined cultural elements with innovative gameplay, leaving a lasting impression on its audience.</p>

                    <h5>2017 - 2019</h5>
                    <p>Tactics was an innovative freemium mobile strategy game that blended elements of collectible card games and base defense strategy. Players could strategically build and customize their defenses while assembling decks of troops and buff cards to launch attacks on other players or progress through challenging campaign levels.

                        As part of the development process, I contributed to crafting a gameplay experience that balanced strategic depth with accessibility, ensuring player engagement through a combination of tactical decision-making and progression mechanics. Although the project was ultimately unreleased, it demonstrated a novel approach to combining two popular genres and remains a valuable learning experience in designing unique and engaging player experiences.</p>

                    Glass Garden was a farming management game in which you plant and maintain different kinds of flowers.
                    Using the application you can virtually grow different plants and learn how to satisfy the different needs of each plant. 
                    Controlling different attributes like the amount of sunlight or water and airflow requirements for each plant.
                    The goal of the application was to help people to keep their plant needs on watch and maintain their plant as best using the application guidance.</p>

In this game, each player got a role and need to compete with other players on each round to win. players got different goals based on their roles and different abilities to use in each round. Working with huge amount of data and game balance was one of the most enjoyable challenges for me in this project.</p>
