            <p>
              Wintor is an augmented reality platform designed to bridge the gap
              between physical and virtual experiences. I worked on designing
              and optimizing AR tours, focusing on user-centric features and
              seamless cross-platform functionality. My role involved enhancing
              the app’s code infrastructure, integrating advanced AR/VR
              libraries, and ensuring consistent performance across mobile and
              web platforms. By actively observing user behavior on-site, I
              reshaped features, improved the UI/UX, and contributed to creating
              engaging, easy-to-use AR content. Wintor exemplifies my passion
              for immersive technologies and innovation in storytelling.

              Magrid is an educational mobile app that empowers young learners
              with its innovative approach to visual learning. I spearheaded the
              development and optimization of the app on Unity, ensuring its
              availability across multiple platforms including iOS and Android.
              Magrid is now used in over five countries and more than 400
              schools, positively impacting the education of thousands of
              students. My contributions included developing user-friendly
              features, managing app store deployments, and integrating
              cross-platform solutions to enhance accessibility and engagement.
              Magrid stands as a testament to my ability to create impactful,

            <p>
              Northern Farm was a unique farming simulation game with a
              distinctive Persian theme, featuring localized items, ingredients,
              and engaging mini-games. The project included the development of
              social features, such as clans and item trading, as well as
              special themed live events to enhance player engagement and
              retention. As part of the design and development team, I focused
              on improving key performance indicators (KPIs) and revenue through
              data-driven strategies. These included implementing A/B tests,
              analyzing player behavior, and introducing features to optimize
              the game’s lifecycle and maximize player satisfaction. Though no
              longer available, Northern Farm remains a highlight of my career
              as it combined cultural elements with innovative gameplay, leaving
              a lasting impression on its audience.

            <h5>2017 - 2019</h5>
            <p>
              Tactics was an innovative freemium mobile strategy game that
              blended elements of collectible card games and base defense
              strategy. Players could strategically build and customize their
              defenses while assembling decks of troops and buff cards to launch
              attacks on other players or progress through challenging campaign
              levels. As part of the development process, I contributed to
              crafting a gameplay experience that balanced strategic depth with
              accessibility, ensuring player engagement through a combination of
              tactical decision-making and progression mechanics. Although the
              project was ultimately unreleased, it demonstrated a novel
              approach to combining two popular genres and remains a valuable
              learning experience in designing unique and engaging player
              experiences.

              Glass Garden was a farming management game in which you plant and

              virtually grow different plants and learn how to satisfy the
              different needs of each plant. Controlling different attributes
              like the amount of sunlight or water and airflow requirements for
              each plant. The goal of the application was to help people to keep
              their plant needs on watch and maintain their plant as best using
              the application guidance.

              different abilities to use in each round. Working with huge amount
